trufflehog integration game plan
Scope & success criteria

Guard every push/PR against leaked credentials using TruffleHog’s GitHub Action (docs ↗).
Keep automation-first compliance: ≥90 % of the workflow automated via GitHub Actions; manual steps limited to approvals when real secrets surface.
Produce zero false positives on merge by building a vetted allowlist/baseline and documenting how to maintain it.
Workflow design

Add a dedicated secret-scan-trufflehog.yml (name TBD) triggered on push/pull_request to protected branches plus workflow_dispatch.
Job outline:
Checkout with event-aware fetch-depth so TruffleHog diff-scans only what changed (per the shallow-clone guidance in the upstream README).
Run trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main with extra_args: --results=verified,unknown --fail so the job exits 183 when verified/unknown secrets appear.
Upload scan artifacts (results.json, HTML summary) for auditing.
Optional nightly cron job to re-scan the full repo and alert via issue/comment if anything new is detected.
Configuration & baselining

Create a security/trufflehog-allowlist.json (or .yaml) containing known safe patterns/paths; keep it minimal and reviewed.
Document a baselining run (trufflehog git file://. --fail --json > security/trufflehog-baseline.json) so we can pre-approve historic findings without disabling future catches.
Wire the workflow to pass the allowlist/baseline via extra_args --exclude-paths or the forthcoming config file to suppress accepted matches.
Developer tooling

Plan a cross-platform helper script (scripts/security/run-trufflehog.sh + run-trufflehog.ps1) that mirrors CI flags so engineers can reproduce failures locally.
Add optional pre-commit hook instructions referencing trufflehog git file://. --since-commit origin/main --fail.
Documentation updates

Extend TESTING.md (or author docs/SECURITY.md) with:
When the scan runs and how to interpret failures.
Steps for updating the baseline/allowlist (require PR + security review).
Escalation path when a credential is verified live.
Update any contributing/onboarding docs so new contributors install TruffleHog locally if desired.
Verification plan

Dry-run the new workflow on a feature branch seeded with a fake canary token to confirm detection.
Confirm failure mode returns 183 and blocks the PR.
Ensure re-runs after updating the allowlist succeed, demonstrating false-positive mitigation.
Track runtime (<5 min target) and adjust depth or caching if needed.
Risks & mitigations

Risk	Mitigation
False positives halting pipelines	Tight allowlist, use --results=verified,unknown to avoid unverified noise, document escalation.
Long runtimes on large histories	Event-aware shallow clone; optional --since-commit to limit scope.
Secret in history prior to baseline	Initial manual review during baseline generation; treat findings as incident if genuinely sensitive.
Tool drift (new CLI options)	Pin action to a specific release tag, review changelog quarterly, add Renovate-style reminder.
Acceptance criteria

CI workflow fails any PR introducing unapproved secrets and uploads artifacts for investigation.
Baseline/allowlist checked into security/ with documented maintenance procedure.
Supporting docs updated; developers can reproduce scans locally.
Stakeholder sign-off that automation coverage and reporting meet security expectations.
next steps (awaiting approval)
Green-light the plan.
Implement the CI workflow, helper scripts, and docs per the outlined steps.
Run validation and iterate on allowlist/baseline with the security stakeholder.
