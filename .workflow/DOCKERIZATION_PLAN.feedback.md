## Review Summary

- The plan captures many core tasks (script hardening, Docker packaging, validation).
- Several specification mismatches and missing research deliverables should be addressed before implementation approval.

## Alignment with Assignment Requirements

| Requirement | Assessment | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Use `.scripts/prompt-agent.sh` as container entrypoint | ⚠️ Needs update | Plan targets `.workflow/prompt.sh`; repository currently lacks `.scripts/prompt-agent.sh`. Clarify whether to create/adapt this script and ensure Docker entrypoint conforms to assignment. |
| Base image `ghcr.io/nam20485/agents-prebuild:main-latest` | ✅ Covered | Dockerfile template references the correct base image. |
| Validate workflows run in container | ⚠️ Expand | Validation section mentions running a sample workflow but does not specify acceptance evidence (logs, exit codes). Recommend defining concrete validation steps and artifacts. |
| Research Claude COE & OpenCode inside Docker | ⚠️ Missing | Plan does not document research findings or link to resources/tools for CLI authentication within containers. Include research summary and actionable setup steps (e.g., required binaries, config paths). |
| Authentication challenges (opencode preferred) | ✅ Partially | Strategy favors env-var API keys, which aligns with non-interactive auth; clarify handling for Claude COE if required and document fallback if env-var auth unavailable. |

## Key Gaps & Risks

1. **Entrypoint ambiguity** – Assignment explicitly names `.scripts/prompt-agent.sh`, yet plan centers on `.workflow/prompt.sh`. Resolve script responsibilities (create the missing `.scripts/prompt-agent.sh`, ensure it delegates to the enhanced script, and reflect this in Dockerfile/compose).
2. **Undefined workflow variable** – Plan notes `$workflow_name` issue but acceptance criteria should ensure remediation (e.g., environment variable defaults, validation failure modes).
3. **Research deliverable absent** – Provide references/commands verifying Claude COE vs OpenCode CLIs install paths in the base image and document any additional tooling required.
4. **Secrets management** – Expand on secure secret injection: recommend Docker secrets or bind-mounted files, and describe how validation will avoid logging secret values.
5. **Validation depth** – Define how success will be demonstrated (sample workflow name, expected outputs, log capture, exit code checks) and how failures will be reported.

## Recommendations

1. Add a planning section that maps how `.scripts/prompt-agent.sh` will bootstrap the workflow (including argument parsing and environment preparation) and ensure Docker `ENTRYPOINT` uses it.
2. Include a research appendix summarizing tested approaches for authenticating both clients inside Docker, with command snippets and noted blockers.
3. Extend acceptance criteria with explicit artifacts (e.g., "Validation run logs stored under `docker/validation/` with PASS/FAIL status").
4. Clarify whether Compose is required for single-container runs; if optional, justify complexity or defer to later iteration.
5. Document how health checks (mentioned as enhancement) would integrate if implemented, or mark as out-of-scope to avoid accidental scope creep.

## Next Steps Before Approval

- Update the plan to address the entrypoint discrepancy and the missing `.scripts/prompt-agent.sh` deliverable.
- Incorporate documented research findings for both Claude COE and OpenCode CLIs in Docker.
- Refine validation/acceptance criteria with concrete success measures and evidence requirements.
- Re-submit the revised plan for review once the above points are covered.
