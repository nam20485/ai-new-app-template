# TruffleHog baseline snapshot
#
# Record known historical findings here so that the security team can
# track investigations and remediation decisions. The automation scripts
# do not consume this file directly; it is a source of truth for manual
# reviews and future enhancements.
#
# Use `scripts/security/run-trufflehog.sh --ci --json-output <path>` to
# generate a fresh report, review the results with the security team,
# then update this baseline accordingly.
